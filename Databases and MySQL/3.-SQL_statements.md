# Read tables with SELECT statement 

```SELECT FROM``` is the command to read a table as in the example below

``` SELECT * FROM stocks;```

If we execute this line, we will obtain every row and column from the table stocks. The asterisk means "all the columns"

If we want to select just a few columns run the next code

``` SELECT symbol, date, close FROM stocks; ```

So we will see in the screen just these 3 fields

# Select only the UNIQUE values

When querying data from a table, you may get duplicate rows. To remove these duplicate rows, you use the ```DISTINCT``` clause in the ```SELECT``` statement.

It is also a way to remove duplicates (by the SELECT columns). So, probably if we execute the code below, we will obtain the same output as before, because
there is only one instance by day and symbol, so no duplicates will be found

```
SELECT DISTINCT
    symbol, date, close 
FROM
    stocks
```

However, if we execute the next script, we will obtain the list of every company symbol without duplicities

```
SELECT DISTINCT
    symbol
FROM
    stocks
```

When executing the ```SELECT``` statement with the ```DISTINCT``` clause, MySQL evaluates the ```DISTINCT``` clause after the ```FROM```, ```WHERE```, and ```SELECT``` clause and before the ```ORDER BY``` clause:

# Change column FORMAT

How to use the MySQL FORMAT function to format decimal numbers in various locales.

```FORMAT(N,D,locale);```

The FORMAT function accepts three arguments:

The N is the number that you want to format. In our case, we will introduce the column name

The D is the number of decimal places that you want to round.

The locale is an optional argument that determines the thousand separators and grouping between separators. If you omit the locale operator, MySQL will use en_US by default.

# Change DATE_FORMAT 

The ```DATE_FORMAT```` function accepts two arguments:

date: is a valid date value that you want to format

format: is a format string that consists of predefined specifiers. Each specifier is preceded by a percentage character ( % ). In this link you can explore all the datetime options that exist (https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-date_format/)

### Format-changing examples

Here we change the format of two variables, price and date_of_transactions. The ```as``` command is used to give a name to the new variable. If we put the same name as the original variable, we are overwriting the existent one, like in the date_of_transaction column



```select *, format(price,2) as price_two_decimals, date_format(date_of_transactions, '%d-%b-%Y') as date_of_transaction from titles```

# ORDER BY

When you use the ```SELECT``` statement to query data from a table, the order of rows in the result set is unspecified. To sort the rows in the result set, you add the ```ORDER BY``` clause in the ```SELECT``` statement.

```
SELECT *
FROM titles
ORDER BY date_of_transaction
```

In this case, the output will be sorted by date, so from the most ancient to the most recent. You can also specify the direction of the order by adding the command ```ASC``` or ```DESC```. If you type ```DESC``` the table will be sorted from the most recent to the most ancient.

Furthermore, you can order by more than one variable. Hence, if two rows have the same date, the second order condition depends on the price, from the cheapest to the most expensive 

```
SELECT *
FROM titles
ORDER BY date_of_transaction, price
```
What do you think if you run the next code


```
SELECT *
FROM titles
ORDER BY date_of_transaction ASC, price DESC
```

# GROUP BY

In SQL, the ```GROUP BY``` clause is used to group rows from a table based on the values in one or more columns. It is often used in combination with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group of rows. Aggregate functions such as ```SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN```

For example, if you want to know the average quantity of sales by store, you run the next code

```
SELECT *, AVG(qty) as average_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY stor_id
```
You see that the output table has as many rows as the different categories the group by variable has

Similarly to ```ORDER BY```, If you want to group by several variables, you run:

```
SELECT *, AVG(qty) as average_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY stor_id, payterms
```

Now, the output table has as many rows as unique combinations of values in those two variables

# WHERE clause for filtering data


In SQL, the ```WHERE``` clause is used to filter rows from a table based on a specified condition. It allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet the criteria you specify. In the example the condiction is that price must be lower than 15€

```
SELECT *
FROM titles
WHERE price < 15
```

# HAVING clause

In SQL, the ```HAVING``` clause is used in combination with the ```GROUP BY``` clause to filter the results of a query based on aggregate functions. It allows you to filter groups of rows that meet specific conditions after the grouping and aggregation have been performed.

The ```HAVING``` clause operates similarly to the ```WHERE``` clause, but while the ```WHERE``` clause filters individual rows before grouping and aggregation, the ```HAVING``` clause filters groups of rows after grouping and aggregation.

```
SELECT *, AVG(qty) as average_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY stor_id, payterms
HAVING average_quantity < 15;
```

# CASE ... WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE... END ... AS ...

In SQL, the ```CASE``` expression is a powerful tool used to perform conditional logic within queries. It allows you to define conditions and return different values or expressions based on those conditions. The ```CASE``` expression is often used to create calculated columns or provide custom labels in result sets.

Next, we build a new column called Price_status. If the price is higher than 15€, we consider this title as expensive. If lower or equal to 15 it is cheap. If none of the two previous conditions is met, then the new column will take the value Unknown. 

```
SELECT *,
CASE 
    WHEN price > 15 THEN 'Expensive'
    WHEN price <= 15 THEN 'Cheap'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS Price_status
FROM titles
```

# SQL operators

SQL operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data in SQL queries. Especially useful in the ```CASE WHEN```statements. They help manipulate and compare data, filter rows, and perform calculations. Here are some common types of SQL operators:


SQL operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data in SQL queries. They help manipulate and compare data, filter rows, and perform calculations. Here are some common types of SQL operators:

#### Arithmetic Operators:

+ Addition +

- Subtraction -

* Multiplication *

- Division /

- Modulus (division remainder) % or MOD

#### Comparison Operators:

- = Equal to

- != or <> Not equal to

- < Less than

- $\gt$ Greater than
 
- <= Less than or equal to

$\geq$ Greater than or equal to

#### Logical Operators:

- AND: Logical AND

- OR: Logical OR

- NOT: Logical NOT

#### Concatenation Operator:

- || or CONCAT(): Concatenates strings together

#### Pattern Matching Operators:

- LIKE: Matches a pattern in text (supports wildcards)

- IN: Checks if a value exists in a list of values

#### NULL Comparison Operators:

- IS NULL: Checks if a value is NULL

- IS NOT NULL: Checks if a value is not NULL

#### Between Operator:

- BETWEEN: Checks if a value falls within a range
