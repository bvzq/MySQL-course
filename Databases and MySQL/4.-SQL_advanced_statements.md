- subqueries
- SQL queries with Excel

# JOIN

JOIN operator combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column (or columns) between them. It allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables by specifying the relationship between them. 
Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN), RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN), and FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN).

**INNER JOIN:**

- Returns only the matching rows from both tables.
- If there's no match between the tables' columns, those rows are excluded from the result.
- Useful for retrieving data that exists in both tables and meets certain criteria.

**LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN):**

- Returns all rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table.
- If there's no match for a row in the left table, the result contains NULL values for columns from the right table.
- Useful for retrieving all records from the left table and matching data from the right table, even if some records in the left table have no match in the right table.

**RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**

- Similar to the LEFT JOIN, but it returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
- If there's no match for a row in the right table, the result contains NULL values for columns from the left table.
- This type of join is less common, as it can often be achieved using a LEFT JOIN with the table order reversed.

**FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN):**

- Returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values in columns where there's no match in either table.
- Useful for retrieving all records from both tables and identifying unmatched rows in each table.

Here we join tables orders and customers. Let's see the differences in the outputs

We select the 6 variables we want to have in the final table. From both tables. Inputing ```LEFT``` we ensure that the output table will have the same number of rows than orders, which is the first table (left table). We match both tables ```ON``` the field customerNumber (if they have different names in each tables it also works).

Every customer that still has no made any order won't appear in the orders table, so it won't has any orderNumber, nor orderDate nor status. The goal of this table is to show some order details such as the date or status and the address and name of the customer that has received the order. 

```
SELECT a.orderNumber, a.orderDate, a.status, b.customerNumber, b.customerName, b.addressLine1  
FROM orders as a 
LEFT JOIN customers as b 
ON a.customerNumber = b.customerNumber;
```

Anagously, if we change ```LEFT``` for ```RIGHT```, we will have at minimum as many rows as customers we have in our database. However, if a customer has more than one order, it will have more than one row. In the LEFT example this is not possible because of the relantionship type between orders and customers. One order is just made for one client, but one client can have several orders.

```
SELECT a.orderNumber, a.orderDate, a.status, b.customerNumber, b.customerName, b.addressLine1  
FROM orders as a 
RIGHT JOIN customers as b 
ON a.customerNumber = b.customerNumber;
```

But if we want only the information of the customers that already has any order we input the ```INNER``` join.

```
SELECT a.orderNumber, a.orderDate, a.status, b.customerNumber, b.customerName, b.addressLine1  
FROM orders as a 
INNER JOIN customers as b 
ON a.customerNumber = b.customerNumber;
```

### Curiosity

Running the next code which makes a RIGHT JOIN adding an ORDER BY statement we find the customers that still didn't make orders

```
SELECT a.orderNumber, a.orderDate, a.status, b.customerNumber, b.customerName, b.addressLine1  
FROM orders as a 
RIGHT JOIN customers as b 
ON a.customerNumber = b.customerNumber
ORDER BY a.orderrNumber;
```

# Subqueries

SQL subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are queries embedded within another query. They are used to retrieve data that will be used as input for the main query. Subqueries allow you to perform complex operations by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. 

The code below return a table with the orderNumber, the total price, the number or items, the date and the status of the order. Like a receipt. In the subquery it is gathered and calculated the total price and the quantity of orders by item

```
select a.orderNumber, total_price, sum(quantityOrdered) as number_items, shippedDate, status
		from orders as a
        left join (select orderNumber, quantityOrdered, quantityOrdered * priceEach as total_price
					from orderDetails) as b
		on a.orderNumber = b.orderNumber
    group by orderNumber;
```

# SQL with Excel

In this section, we'll establish a connection between a SQL database and Excel. This linkage facilitates data import and table joinning using queries, as well as everything learnt in the SQL chapters, also it streamlines the process of refreshing and updating data within an Excel sheet, making the whole procedure quick and convenient.

Firstly we need to install a MySQL complement ODBC connector. ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is utilized to connect MySQL and Excel due to its standardized approach for data interaction across diverse systems. This enables seamless communication between MySQL databases and Excel spreadsheets, ensuring efficient data exchange, analysis, and reporting. ODBC ensures compatibility, simplifies integration, and enhances data-driven workflows between these two widely used platforms.

We find the link for downloading here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/ 

- File>Account>About Excel you can find your version of Excel (32 or 64 bit)
- You can also follow these instructions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK9gPEF606U

Follow these steps afterhaving installed:
- Save an excel as macro enabled
- Data>get data> from other sources>from ODBC
- Select the database connection we have created (EY_database)
- In advanced options we paste a query which output we want to import from excel
  	- If we don't paste any query then we will be able to import entire tables
- Then we can load directly or transform data (PowerQuery)

- Selecting a cell from the returned table a Query Tab appears, there the query is editable. For example we add the column ```comments```
