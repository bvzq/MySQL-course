# Exercise SQL and Excel

- In MySQL defined a query joining titles and sales tables from the publications database
- Connect Excel with the publications database inserting that query
- Insert a Pivot Table that calcuates the total Qty of titles sold by store
- Back in MySQL, insert the next rows
    - in title table: ('BU9999','Guide','business','9999','50','9999','410','99','Illustrated.','1999-06-12 00:00:00')
    - in sales table: ('6380','9999','1999-09-14 00:00:00','99','Net 60','BU9999')
- In excel, refresh the output in the Query Tab, has your PivotTable changed? Then your connection is working properly
