* What do you think will happen if you create a table with a foreign key before creating the table with the corresponding primary key? we recommend you start defining the
  tables without foreign key dependencies, such as authors, jobs or stores.   

* Don't look at the publications_create_table.sql file before having try several times

#### 3) Use the provided script (publications_insert_into.sql) to insert the data into the tables
* Make some ```SELECT``` to be sure you have loaded the data properly
