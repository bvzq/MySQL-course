# What is a database? 

A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. It stores information like text, numbers, images, and more, making it easy to access, update, and analyze. 
Databases serve various purposes, from storing business records to powering web applications, offering a foundation for data-driven activities.

## What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into structured tables with predefined relationships between them. 
It uses the principles of the relational model, where data is stored in rows and columns, and relationships are established using keys. We can interpret graphicly those relationships
through an Entity-Relational Diagram.

In this example we have several tables storing customer information. Also data on payments, products and orders. All these tables are related each other by unique and identifier key fields. 
For example, the Customer number, which could be the national identification number, or the order number, in which each shopping cart has its own identification code.

## Measures and dimensions

In addition to the identifiers we have the measures and dimensions fields. 

- Measures are the columns with numerical values, from where we can make mathematical operations such as addition, average, median
- Dimensions are fields with categorical values, such as civil state, nationality, sex, blood type...

One of the goals of data analytics is to combine measures and dimensions to get insights from data. Thus, we can calculate the average income salary grouped by civil state

May you find the identifier, measures and dimensions in the Penguins dataset we worked on in Excel lessons?

# Primary and Foreign keys

A **primary key** is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key follows these rules:

- A primary key must contain unique values. If the primary key consists of multiple columns, the combination of values in these columns must be unique.
- A primary key column cannot have NULL values. Any attempt to insert or update NULL to primary key columns will result in an error. Note that MySQL implicitly adds a NOT NULL constraint to primary key columns.
- A table can have one an only one primary key.

Because MySQL works faster with integers, the data type of the primary key column should be the integer.

A **foreign key** is a column or group of columns in a table that links to a column or group of columns in another table. 
The foreign key places constraints on data in the related tables, which allows MySQL to maintain referential integrity.

In the example above, the Customer number is the primary key of the customer table. It is related to the orders table, because Customers make orders.

The customer number in the Orders table is a foreign key. While the Order number is the primary key. There is only one Customer number by client in the Customer table, but
there can be multiple repetitions of the Customer number in the Orders table, because one client can make as many orders as it wants. However, in the Orders table each Order number is different from the others,
to be identified easily. 

On the other hand, the Order number is a foreign key of the table Order details. Each order may have several items, which are also uniquely identified in the Order details table.


## Relational types between tables

As we see in the example above, several types of relationships can exist between tables. 
These relationships define how data in different tables are related to each other and how they can be combined and queried.

- **One-to-One (1:1) Relationship**: Each record in the first table is associated with only one record in the second table, and vice versa.
This relationship is relatively rare and is typically used to split data into separate tables for organizational or performance reasons.

- **One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship**: Each record in the first table is associated with multiple records in the second table,
but each record in the second table is associated with only one record in the first table. For example, a customer can have multiple orders, but each order belongs to one customer.

- **Many-to-Many (N:N) Relationship**: Multiple records in both the first and second tables are associated with each other.
For example, students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

These relationships are fundamental for establishing connections and dependencies between data in different tables, ensuring data integrity, and enabling efficient querying and reporting. They are often represented graphically using entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), which help visualize the structure and connections within a database schema.

# ACID database properties

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that ensure the reliability and integrity of transactions in a database management system (DBMS). 
ACID properties are crucial for maintaining data accuracy and consistency, even during system failures. 

Before entering in detail about ACID concepts, let's explain what a transaction is. A transaction is a sequence of one or more operations that are treated as a single unit of work. For example, when a new client
makes an order, the next transactions are carried out:

- In the Customers table, a new instance is created with its personal data, Customer number, name, address, phone, profile photo...
- In the Orders table, a new row is inserted with the order information: date, number of items, total price...
- In the Order detail table, it will be created as many rows as items has the order made by the customer, including quantity of items, unit price...

#### Atomicity: 
Transactions are atomic, which means they are treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either the entire transaction is completed successfully, or none of its changes are applied. 
If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.

That means if fails the creation of the new Customer in the Customer table, none of the changes in the Order or Order detail tables are applied. If the three actions are not accomplished, none will be.

#### Consistency: 
After a transaction is completed, the database transitions from one consistent state to another. This means that the data must satisfy certain predefined rules, constraints, and integrity conditions before and after the transaction. Consistency ensures that the data remains valid and adheres to the business logic.

Data consistency ensures the reliability of the data, thus if in the orders table the field "number of items" does not match with the real number of items in the Order details table, data is not consistent. 
In other words, data must be coherent for every table.

#### Isolation:
Transactions are executed in isolation from each other. Even when multiple transactions are executed concurrently, each transaction sees the database as if it were the only transaction running. 
Isolation prevents interference and ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions doesn't lead to data inconsistencies.

Regarding our example, if two customers make an order "at the same time" the database transactions will be updated one by one, until the first order information is not completed, the next one does not start.

One inconsistency may exist: Each customer makes orders through and employee so, on the employees table could be a field "total number of customers associated". If an employee achieves several orders from several clients,
the field "total number of customers associated" must be updated separately, if not, the calculation could be wrongly updated and "forget" one client.

#### Durability:
Once a transaction is committed, its changes become permanent and are stored in a durable manner. 
This means that even if the system crashes or power failures, the changes made by committed transactions are retained in the database.

Completed transactions, as an order made by one customer, must be stored indefinitely.


# Data types

A database table contains multiple columns with specific data types such as numeric or string. MySQL provides more data types other than just numeric and string. Each data type in MySQL can be determined by the following characteristics:

- The kind of values it represents.
- The space that takes up and whether the values are a fixed-length or variable length.
- The values of the data type can be indexed or not.
- How MySQL compares the values of a specific data type.
