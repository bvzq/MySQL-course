# At the end of this lesson you will learn:

- Create a database in two different ways
- Populate a database in two different ways
- Draw the Entity-Relationship Model

# Create a database using MySQL Workbench

First, launch the MySQL Workbench and click the setup new connection button as shown in the following screenshot:

Second, type the name for the connection and click the Test Connection button.

MySQL Workbench displays a dialog asking for the password of the root user:

You need to (1) type the password for the root user, (2) check the Save password in vault, and (3) click OK button.

Third, double-click the connection name Local to connect to the MySQL Server.

MySQL Workbench opens the following window which consists of four parts: Navigator, Query, Information, and Output.

# Create a database using SQL script

To create a new database in MySQL, you use the CREATE DATABASE statement with the following syntax:

```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `stockify`;
USE `stockify`;
```

Analogously, if we want to delete a database

```
DROP database `stockify`;
```

In this syntax:

- Specify the name of the database after the CREATE DATABASE keywords. The database name must be unique within a MySQL server instance.
If you attempt to create a database with a name that already exists, MySQL will issue an error.
- Use the IF NOT EXISTS option to conditionally create a database if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Specify the character set and collation for the new database. If you skip the CHARACTER SET and COLLATE clauses, MySQL will the default character set and collation for the new database.

# Create tables

We specify the table's name, the variables and their data type.

Also the primary key and we set up the union between the company table and stocks table: symbol is the union field.


```
create table `stocks`(
`stock_id` int,
`date` date,
`open` float,
`high` float,
`low` float,
`close` float,
`volume` float,
`symbol` char(4) not null,
PRIMARY KEY (`stock_id`),
CONSTRAINT `stock_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`symbol`) REFERENCES `company` (`symbol`)
)
```

# Populate a database - INSERT INTO command 

The following INSERT statement allows you to insert multiple rows into the books table:

```
INSERT INTO company(symbol, company_name, sec_fillings, sector, sub_industry, Headquarters, start_date, CIK, founded)
VALUES('MMM', '3M', 'reports', 'Industrials', 'Industrial Conglomerates', 'Saint Paul, Minnesota', '1976-09-08', '66740', 1902),
      ('MSFT', 'Microsoft', 'reports', 'Software', 'Software', 'Saint Paul, Minnesota', '1976-09-08', '66740', 1902);
```

# Populate database massively

As we can see with the ```INSERT INTO``` command we insert row by row. Sometimes it is not the best way. So there are two other ways of doing it massively.

## Insert data massively using code

```
LOAD DATA INFILE './SQL EY/stockify/stocks.csv' 
INTO TABLE stocks 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ';' 
/*ENCLOSED BY '"'*/
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

## Insert data massively with the assistant

Run some ```SELECT``` statement, click on this button and follow the instructions of the assistant. It could take several minutes
